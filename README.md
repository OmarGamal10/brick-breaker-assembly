# Brick Breaker Game - Developed in Assembly Language

## üéÆ About The Game

Welcome to the classic **Brick Breaker** game, developed using **Assembly Language**! This retro arcade game challenges you to break all the bricks with a bouncing ball while controlling a paddle. Get ready for some nostalgic fun and see how long you can last!

The game features:
- **Sleek 2D graphics** rendered using low-level Assembly instructions
- **Simple controls** that test your reflexes and precision
- **Increasing levels of difficulty** as you clear bricks
- **Score tracking** to see how you rank as you progress
- **Optimized performance** for minimal CPU usage

Are you ready to break some bricks and beat your high score? Let's play!

## üöÄ Features

- **Paddle Control**: Move the paddle left and right using keyboard input.
- **Ball Bounce**: The ball bounces off walls, bricks, and the paddle to clear the board.
- **Multiple Levels**: The difficulty increases as you progress, with more bricks and faster gameplay.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your progress and try to beat your highest score.
- **Retro Vibes**: A nostalgic 80s arcade-style game, built with the power of Assembly language!

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

This game is coded in **x86 Assembly language**. It uses **BIOS interrupts** to handle input, display graphics, and manage game logic. Through this project, we explore low-level programming concepts like:
- Handling keyboard input directly
- Implementing simple 2D graphics using pixel manipulation
- Optimizing code for minimal CPU usage

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Assembly Language** (x86)
- **BIOS Interrupts** for graphics rendering and input handling
- **Basic Game Loop** for continuous gameplay

## ‚ö° How To Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the program and watch the opening screen appear.
2. **Control the Paddle**: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle and catch the ball.
3. **Break the Bricks**: The ball bounces off the paddle and hits the bricks. Try to break them all!
4. **Beat the Levels**: With each level, the game becomes more challenging. Can you clear all the levels?
5. **Track Your Score**: The score is displayed at the top of the screen. How high can you go?
